      <description>Protection and the Origins of Institutional Trust: Evidence from Protection Rackets in Eastern DRCongo
As armed actors attempt to establish local monopolies on violence, civilians face a dangerous choice: do they trust the armed group to provide security, exchanging regular tribute for protection from violence, despite their limited leverage to stop the security provider from abusing their coercive power? Or do they reject the armed actors by fleeing, passively resisting, or attempting to provide security themselves?</description>

      <description>A Taxonomy of Criminal Governance: Evidence from Rio de Janeiro
Why did colonial powers establish courts to address Indigenous grievances? Under which conditions did these rulers decide to rule in favor of Indigenous claimants, even at the expense of their own state agents? This paper addresses these questions by studying the legal battles between Indigenous communities, Spanish settlers, and local bureaucrats in the General Indian Court of colonial Mexico (GIC).</description>

      <description>Multiple Supervision in Reform China
I provide a research memo that is part of the design for a proposed dissertation chapter. Because it’s a “later” chapter, it takes a lot of things as given. I try to cover that ground quickly on the front end of the memo. I welcome comments about any aspect of the memo, but I am particularly perplexed by how to resolve some of the problems with the theory-to-empirical strategy match-up that I discuss in the research design section.</description>

      <description>How to Repel a Rebel: State Presence in Colonial Burma
My dissertation project seeks to understand the strategy behind the colonial states in pursuing the two types of state-building process: (1) investments in physical coercion, and (2) investments in education. The project will look at what functions these two processes can serve to the colonial states, and consequently, what the colonial states pursued, when there is a risk of economic instability and violent conflict.</description>

      <description>How Effective Are Political Solutions to Ethnic Bias? Caste and Clean Drinking Water in Rural India
Social scientists have documented prevalent ingroup bias in human societies, but the empirical evidence on effective strategies to reduce such unequal treatment to marginalized groups remains thin. We focus on caste-based bias in India’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh, with a population of 200 million and one-fifth of them from the lower castes (Dalits, or scheduled castes).</description>

      <description>Do interaction and advocacy catalyze environmental policy leadership?
International efforts to address environmental challenges increasingly rely on the information, capacity, and will of policymakers to act as policy leaders at the national level. What countries have taken the lead in the development of environmental policy? Do international interaction and transnational advocacy catalyze environmental policy leadership? Combining a novel network-based measurement approach and a new database of environmental policy innovation adoptions, I will dynamically measure environmental policy leadership at the global level and estimate its relationship with interaction and advocacy using causally-identified spatial and network regression models.</description>

      <description>Usurping the Leader: A Comparative Analysis of Party Leadership Changes
Co-authored with Christine Sylvester (University of Binghamton)
Party leaders are seen as the face and central control of a political party’s agenda (also possibly the legislature). This asks the question, with all this power why would a leader ever relinquish their position? Little work has looked comparatively at why leaders step down from office due to data limitations. We contribute to the literature on party politics and leader tenure by providing a new dataset of leadership changes in advanced industrial democracies from 1960-2017.</description>

      <description>Warring Memories: The Political Behavior Legacies of World War II in Germany
Does conflict-induced resettlement produce durable political behavior legacies? I investigate this question by focusing on the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe into West Germany at the end of World War II. These expellees wanted to regain their lost lands and for broader society to acknowledge their suffering. In time, such demands for recognition and restitution received little support outside far-right parties.</description>

      <description>Colonial grievances and uprisings in Korea
Does history matter when it comes to explaining violence against civilians during wars? How does a region’s history of communal conflict or resistance against authority influence the intentional killing of civilians by armed groups? In this paper, I argue that a region that have more records of economic tension among villagers also experience more violence against civilians during future armed conflicts. I further argue that a region’s record of resistance against authority, conditional on the relationship between past and current authorities, can lead to more civilian killings.</description>

      <description>Local Trust in UN Peacekeeping Operations: Survey Evidence from DRCongo
Peacekeeping operations rely on the support of the local population both to gather information and to solidify peace. To gain such support, missions must cultivate trust with the residents in the areas in which they operate. We develop a theory of a transactional model of trust with international peacekeeping missions: those who interact with and benefit from UN peacekeeping missions are more likely to trust it.</description>

      <description>Information, Concessions and Reneging in Authoritarian Regimes
How does information affect how autocratic governments make concessions to subnational protest campaigns? I argue the strategic purpose of concessions varies depending on the level of information about the grievance available to the government. In cases where the government has little prior awareness of the motivating grievance, protests convey valuable new information, and concessions are used as a long-term adaptation strategy, to eliminate grievances and prevent citizens from becoming regime opponents.</description>

      <description>Informal Communities and Data Reporting Bias
In addition to buying and selling votes, brokers are often simultaneously in positions of community leadership working on advocacy and governance. Brokerage and community work can in some cases be complementary- the broker’s community work helps build a network which they can leverage to buy votes- but can also be rivalrous { a broker’s electoral work can make their governance efforts more difficult. Does changes in the political environment effect effort and outcomes in grassroots governance?</description>

      <description>Canvassing the Gatekeepers: A Field Experiment to Increase Women’s Electoral Turnout in Pakistan
Ali Cheema, Sarah Khan, Asad Liaqat, and Shandana Khan Mohmand
Abstract
Pakistan has one of the largest gender gaps in turnout among electoral democracies around the world. A widely tested strategy to encourage turnout in a variety of contexts is door-to-door voter canvassing or mobilization. We use a field experiment conducted with 2500 households in the city of Lahore to study the effectiveness of this strategy in increasing women’s turnout in the 2018 Pakistan General Election.</description>

      <description>Projecting Credibility: Alliance Commitments, Security Partnerships, and International Crisis Responses
Todd Lehmann
Abstract
How does the ability to quickly project large-scale military force—such as with transport aircraft and naval aircraft carriers—affect states’ alliances and security partnerships? I argue that states with greater capacity to project force will deploy fewer troops to allies for deterrent purposes. Instead, more capable states can demonstrate their commitment to allies through public words and actions—such as statements by political leaders—supported by the ability to quickly respond to crises.</description>

      <description>Regulatory Arbitrage and Overseas Operation of Multinational Firms
Yilang Feng
Abstract
How does a firm’s global production affect its political strategy to shape its home country regulatory policies? This question lies at the intersection of globalization and corporate political actions, and it is becoming increasingly relevant today with nationalist discontent challenging the global order. To address this question, I develop a theory of regulatory arbitrage: in response to unfavorable regulatory outcomes at home, it is easier for firms with overseas operations to offshore more of their domestic operations abroad, resulting in an outflow of capital and jobs from the home country.</description>

      <description>The Political Relevance of Implicit and Explicit Racialized Schemas about Immigrant Origins: Evidence from the United States and Britain
Kirill Zhirkov
Empirical research consistently demonstrates the importance of racial attitudes in structuring public opinion and political behavior. In this paper, I suggest that the degree to which natives think of immigrants in racial terms is strongly related to attitudes toward immigration. Using the schematic approach to social cognition, I argue that mental associations (schemas) linking immigration to race are formed on the level of origin groups, not individual immigrants.</description>

      <description>Red Memory: Nostalgia, Trauma, and Public Opinion in Contemporary China
Iza Ding (University of Pittsburg) and Jeffrey Javed (University of Michigan)
Abstract
How do citizens remember the political past and how do these memories shape their views of present-day politics? We examine the formation of political memory and its relationship with individual attitudes toward contemporary government policies in China, focusing on Chinese citizens’ memories of the Maoist era (1949-1976). On the basis of 77 intensive semi-structured interviews in four cities, we find that Maoist nostalgia—where it exists—is a reaction to the profound feeling of moral disenchantment many Chinese citizens feel over the complex societal challenges resulting from China’s extraordinary four-decade arc of economic reform.</description>
