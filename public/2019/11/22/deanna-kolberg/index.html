<p><strong><em>Informal Communities and Data Reporting Bias</em></strong></p>
<p>In addition to buying and selling votes, brokers are often simultaneously in positions of
community leadership working on advocacy and governance. Brokerage and community work
can in some cases be complementary- the broker’s community work helps build a network
which they can leverage to buy votes- but can also be rivalrous { a broker’s electoral work
can make their governance efforts more difficult. Does changes in the political environment
effect effort and outcomes in grassroots governance? I demonstrate the connection between
neighborhood leaders’ brokerage and governance work by testing the relationship between levels
of broker competition (a brokerage indicator) and neighborhood membership file completeness
(a governance quality indicator). In doing so, my research expands the literature on broker
behavior by documenting how the governance roles that brokers play in their community are
influenced by their political work and joins a growing literature on the importance of grassroots
actors in everyday political life.</p>
