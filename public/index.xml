      <description>Red Memory: Nostalgia, Trauma, and Public Opinion in Contemporary China
Iza Ding (University of Pittsburg) and Jeffrey Javed (University of Michigan)
Abstract
How do citizens remember the political past and how do these memories shape their views of present-day politics? We examine the formation of political memory and its relationship with individual attitudes toward contemporary government policies in China, focusing on Chinese citizens’ memories of the Maoist era (1949-1976). On the basis of 77 intensive semi-structured interviews in four cities, we find that Maoist nostalgia—where it exists—is a reaction to the profound feeling of moral disenchantment many Chinese citizens feel over the complex societal challenges resulting from China’s extraordinary four-decade arc of economic reform.</description>

      <description>Comparative Politics Reading Lists  Over the past decade, graduate students in the Political Science department have created a valuable common pool resource consisting of course syllabi, reading lists for preliminary exams, and reading notes and summaries. This resource provides a foundation for scholars interested in becoming familiar with the literature on comparative politics. This resource is accessible to University of Michigan-affiliated individuals at this link.
