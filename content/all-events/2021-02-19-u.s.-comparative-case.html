<p>After the events of January 6 and the past four years, there has been an increased interest in looking at the United States as another case of rising populist authoritarianism and potential democratic backsliding. This follows a trend of comparativists urging others not to see the U.S. as an &quot;exceptional&quot; case, and to learn lessons from other country cases. During this panel, we will ask our discussants <strong>Jenna Bednar, Rob Mickey, Dan Slater and Charlotte Cavaille</strong>. to talk about the &quot;state of the subfield&quot; and scholarly benefits in using the U.S. as a case, among other topics.</p>
