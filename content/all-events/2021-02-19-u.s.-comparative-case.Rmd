After the events of January 6 and the past four years, there has been an increased interest in looking at the United States as another case of rising populist authoritarianism and potential democratic backsliding. This follows a trend of comparativists urging others not to see the U.S. as an "exceptional" case, and to learn lessons from other country cases. During this panel, we will ask our discussants **Jenna Bednar, Rob Mickey, Dan Slater and Charlotte Cavaille**.  to talk about the "state of the subfield" and scholarly benefits in using the U.S. as a case, among other topics.
