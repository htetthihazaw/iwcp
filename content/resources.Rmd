<h1><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7XV4xueCwliLWNoVkcyc19pbms?usp=sharing">**Comparative Politics Reading Lists**</a></h1>
Over the past decade, graduate students in the Political Science department have created a valuable common pool resource consisting of course syllabi, reading lists for preliminary exams, and reading notes and summaries. This resource provides a foundation for scholars interested in becoming familiar with the literature on comparative politics. This resource is accessible to University of Michigan-affiliated individuals <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7XV4xueCwliLWNoVkcyc19pbms?usp=sharing">at this link</a>.
