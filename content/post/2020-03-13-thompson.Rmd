***Multiple Supervision in Reform China***

I provide a research memo that is part of the design for a proposed dissertation chapter. Because it’s a “later” chapter, it takes a lot of things as given. I try to cover that ground quickly on the front end of the memo. I welcome comments about any aspect of the memo, but I am particularly perplexed by how to resolve some of the problems with the theory-to-empirical strategy match-up that I discuss in the research design section. I’m currently at the stage of the empirical project where I’m unsure if the difficulties described either make testing my theory in a thoughtful and credible way impossible or sufficiently difficult that the costs of dealing with them will outweigh the benefits.
